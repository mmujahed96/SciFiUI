# Description of the assignment
I created a Sci-Fi User Interface which is based on the idea of Humans living in space for about a hundred years who have no Planet(Earth) to go back to. For generations they have living on a space ship. They are searching for an Earthlike planet in another galaxy and start a new life there. The UI enables the user to know some information about the planets and the species that run the planet.

# Instructions
When the program runs a loading screen with bright circles appears. The User will then need to press 'Enter' which will take them into the main part of Interface. Here there some options for User interaction. If the User hovers over the colorful red bars beside the planet description button then where ever the positions of mouseX and mouseY are the colour will change from red to a dark blue. This only occurs if mouseX and mouseY are on the bars.

Once the User is done with that. They can click the names of the five different planets. This will bring the user to the description of the planet. There is an image with text specifying the planet "Name", "About" and "Species". To go back to the main part the 'Back Space' is required to be pressed. The user can do the same with all the planet buttons.   

The user can then hover over the Sine Wave labelled "Radio Wave". This will alter and increase the frequency of the wave and will also play some static noise while the user still hovers over the wave. When the user is not hovering over the Sine Wave the static sound effects will not play.
# How it works

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

What I am most proud of is that I implemented most ideas thats I planned for this assignment. Getting started was the difficult part for me but with some research and coming up with different ideas, I finally decided on what I wanted to make.

I am really proud that I actually got the 3D shere to rotate even though I considered it a huge challenge for this assignment. I am proud that even when this assignment seemed difficult I kept going and in most cases reached the results I aimed hard for.

I am also very proud with my Sine Wave. Quiet a lot of thinking went into figuring out how to implement the if/else statment within the code for the actual Sine Wave, but I figured it out. Having the static sound there too also makes me proud.

Everyday after spending continuous hours on trying to figure out how to make each of my desired shapes I would create a new plan for the next day, this meant I numbered the different parts of the assignment I needed to finish the following day. If I thought of another way to make a certain shape it was included in my plan. This allowed me to keep track of what I needed to do.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
